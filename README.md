# docify
A Go-based CLI tool that automatically detects your project type (Node.js / Python), backend port, and database usage, then generates a Dockerfile, builds a Docker image, and runs your app in a container with zero hassle.  It even handles MongoDB by injecting a working MONGO_URL so your app runs smoothly both locally and inside Docker. ðŸš€
